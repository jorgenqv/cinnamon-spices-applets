### Troubleshooting

###### Enabling debug mode

You can enable debug mode for more logging by creating a file named ```DEBUG``` in the folder of the applet here: ```~/.local/share/cinnamon/applets/weather@mockturtl/```

###### See the logs producing by applets

You can see Logs by opening the Cinnamon 'Looking Glass' debugger. You can open it by Right Clicking on your Panel (taskbar), then Troubleshoot->Looking Glass

Logs can be found under the ```Log``` Tab.
